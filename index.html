        We want to inform everyone about Covid-19. We want people to be informed so they will take more responsibility for their actions and maybe try to keep their distance from people as much as possible . Everyone in today’s society deserves to know everything about Corona so they know what actions they should take and avoid. 
        Covid-19 is one of the most dangerous things existing in our society and still it is like people do not care about it, people do not care about the distance, they do not care about avoiding big groups of people and that’s why we are here. We want to inform those who do not care and let them know about all of the risks they are taking, they could put their entire family and friends in danger. 
        People should listen to the advice they are getting from their schools, the hospitals and everyone around them and not just let all of the important information go to waste.
