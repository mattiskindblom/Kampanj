    <h2>About us</h2>

   <p>
        We are a campaign that stands for letting everyone in the society know about Covid, we want to inform everyone what actions they should take and which ones they should avoid. Our campaign is made by 3 teenagers or as I would call us, small adults. We are on the peak of becoming adults and we can see the problem, we’re still going to school and we see a lot of stuff that older adults can not see. We can see the problems in our society that the adults won’t believe and now we are here, to inform all of you what we all should avoid, and what we should do.
    </p>
    
    <h2>FAQ</h2>

    <h3>
        What do we have to offer compared to other Covid-19 campaigns? 
    </h3>

    <p>
        As we have mentioned, we are teenagers and we can see a lot of stuff older people can’t see and we want to inform everyone around us of what we see and what we think we should do.
    </p>

    <h3>
        What actions have to be taken?
    </h3>

    <p>
        We think keeping your distance is one of the more important actions, way too many people are pushing through lines of people, way too many people are acting as if they are immortal.
        Another thing that could help is if people would wear facemasks, but it would not help at all if less than 70% of people would wear them because when people cough particles flies out of their mouth and if these particles happens to land on someone's face mask and they take it of they will get these particles on their hands and then make it go everywhere.
    </p>

    <h3>
        Why would I decide to stay home instead of going out partying? 
    </h3>

    <p>
        Covid-19 can be spread around people in a matter of seconds, if one person would have Corona and there is a party with around 100 people in it, that person could spread the virus to all of them by just standing there breathing. Think of your family and friends, if you would happen to get Corona, think how fast that could spread throughout your family. This pandemic is life threatening to a lot of people and if you’re not careful enough you could do a lot of damage to your family but also to the society, you could ruin hundreds of families by spreading the virus to one guy who then spreads it to a few others.
